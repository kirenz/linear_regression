# # 7.8.2 Splines
# 
# In order to fit regression splines in python, we use the ${\tt dmatrix}$ module from the ${\tt patsy}$ library. In lecture, we saw that regression splines can be fit by constructing an appropriate matrix of basis functions. The ${\tt bs()}$ function generates the entire matrix of basis functions for splines with the specified set of knots.  Fitting ${\tt wage}$ to ${\tt age}$ using a regression spline is simple:

# In[3]:


from patsy import dmatrix

# Specifying 3 knots
transformed_x1 = dmatrix("bs(df.age, knots=(25,40,60), degree=3, include_intercept=False)",
                        {"df.age": df.age}, return_type='dataframe')

# Build a regular linear model from the splines
fit1 = sm.GLM(df.wage, transformed_x1).fit()
fit1.params


# Here we have prespecified knots at ages 25, 40, and 60. This produces a
# spline with six basis functions. (Recall that a cubic spline with three knots
# has seven degrees of freedom; these degrees of freedom are used up by an
# intercept, plus six basis functions.) We could also use the ${\tt df}$ option to
# produce a spline with knots at uniform quantiles of the data:

# In[4]:


# Specifying 6 degrees of freedom 
transformed_x2 = dmatrix("bs(df.age, df=6, include_intercept=False)",
                        {"df.age": df.age}, return_type='dataframe')
fit2 = sm.GLM(df.wage, transformed_x2).fit()
fit2.params


# In this case python chooses knots which correspond
# to the 25th, 50th, and 75th percentiles of ${\tt age}$. The function ${\tt bs()}$ also has
# a ${\tt degree}$ argument, so we can fit splines of any degree, rather than the
# default degree of 3 (which yields a cubic spline).
# 
# In order to instead fit a natural spline, we use the ${\tt cr()}$ function. Here
# we fit a natural spline with four degrees of freedom:

# In[5]:


# Specifying 4 degrees of freedom
transformed_x3 = dmatrix("cr(df.age, df=4)", {"df.age": df.age}, return_type='dataframe')
fit3 = sm.GLM(df.wage, transformed_x3).fit()
fit3.params


# As with the ${\tt bs()}$ function, we could instead specify the knots directly using
# the ${\tt knots}$ option.
# 
# Let's see how these three models stack up:

# In[6]:


# Generate a sequence of age values spanning the range
age_grid = np.arange(df.age.min(), df.age.max()).reshape(-1,1)

# Make some predictions
pred1 = fit1.predict(dmatrix("bs(age_grid, knots=(25,40,60), include_intercept=False)",
                             {"age_grid": age_grid}, return_type='dataframe'))
pred2 = fit2.predict(dmatrix("bs(age_grid, df=6, include_intercept=False)",
                             {"age_grid": age_grid}, return_type='dataframe'))
pred3 = fit3.predict(dmatrix("cr(age_grid, df=4)", {"age_grid": age_grid}, return_type='dataframe'))

# Plot the splines and error bands
plt.scatter(df.age, df.wage, facecolor='None', edgecolor='k', alpha=0.1)
plt.plot(age_grid, pred1, color='b', label='Specifying three knots')
plt.plot(age_grid, pred2, color='r', label='Specifying df=6')
plt.plot(age_grid, pred3, color='g', label='Natural spline df=4')
[plt.vlines(i , 0, 350, linestyles='dashed', lw=2, colors='b') for i in [25,40,60]]
