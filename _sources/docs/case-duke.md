# Case study

The goal of this case study is to build a model for predicting the sale price of a house based on a particular homeâ€™s characteristics. 

We will start with data exploration and afterwards demonstrate how to build regression models with different Python modules:

1. [statsmodels](https://www.statsmodels.org/stable/index.html)
1. [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/)

## Data exploration

In November of 2020, information on 98 houses in the Duke Forest neighborhood of Durham, NC were scraped from the real estate marketplace [Zillow](https://www.zillow.com). The homes were all recently sold at the time of data collection.
