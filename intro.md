# Welcome to Linear Regression Models

In this book we cover the basics of linear regression - the fundamental starting point for all regression methods - and how to evaluate the quality of fit of regression models.

Linear regression is still a useful and widely used statistical learning method. Moreover, it serves as a good jumping point for newer approaches. Consequently, the importance of having a good understanding of linear regression before studying more complex learning methods cannot be overstated {cite:t}`James2021`.
